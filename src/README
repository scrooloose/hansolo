Requirements
============

g++
---
In ubuntu: `sudo aptitude install g++'


Ncurses development files
-------------------------
In ubuntu: `sudo aptitude install ncurses-dev'


jsoncpp development files
-------------------------
Downloadable from here: http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/.

Installation is a bit of a slut since there appears to be no automated way to
do it, and the install documentation is shit. This is what I did (for ubuntu):

* wget the file and unpackage it somewhere
* cd into it and run `scons platform=linux-gcc'
* run `sudo cp -r include/json /usr/local/include'
* run `sudo cp -r libs/linux-gcc-4.4.3/libjson_linux-gcc-4.4.3_libmt.so /usr/local/lib/'
* run `sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libjson_linux-gcc-4.4.3_libmt.so /usr/local/lib/libjsoncpp.so'
* run `sudo ldconfig'
